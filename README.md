# Selection sort visualization
![Alt text](screenshot.png?raw=true "Start Screen")

A simple interactive visualization of the selection-sort algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort. 
I'm using the pico-8 color palette for the graphics: https://www.romanzolotarev.com/pico-8-color-palette/.

## How to use
You will need love2d to use this program. Download here: https://love2d.org/. Once installed just drag and drop 
the visualization folder onto the love2d application. 

## Controls
Use left and right arrow-keys to control move the cursor, up and down arrows to increment or decrement the number under the cursor.
Press x at any point to start or stop sorting.
